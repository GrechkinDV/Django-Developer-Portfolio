# Django-Developer-Portfolio
A simple webpage, where I shared some of my projects made using Python(Kivy, TKinter, DJango frameworks), CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, HTML. 
Models.py is empty, while projects' information was manually added at index.html. Such decision was made due to limited information. For future growth, I'll apply Django built-in loop and statement tags along with filling up models.py.
